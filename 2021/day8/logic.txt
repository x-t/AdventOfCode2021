0 - Step 2
1 - Unique (2 segments)
2 - Step 4
3 - Step 3
4 - Unique (4 segments)
5 - Step 4
6 - Step 1
7 - Unique (3 segments)
8 - Unique (7 segments)
9 - Step 2

7 - 1 = Segment A (100%)
4 - 1 = Segments B, D (50%)
8 - 4 - A = Segments E, G (50%)

The 6 segment numbers:
0, 6, 9
8 - D = 0
8 - C = 6
8 - E = 9

Everything from *6 will contain 1 (C&F), apart from 6,
the 6 will now tell the position of C and F definitively.

Now we know A, C and F segment mappings.

Next up, 9 will have all segments from 4, while 0
will not have the D segment, which we can now map.

> Numbers found - 0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
> Segments known - A, C, F, D

The rest of the segments are *5.

3 is made up of A, C, F, D and G. Therefore it'll be the only
one available, and now G can be mapped.

> Numbers found - 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9
> Segments known - A, C, F, D, G

Since only 2 and 5 are left, 5 includes the F segment, while
2 does not. Therefore, we have now mapped all the numbers.

To extract the mappings for 2 leftover segments,

B = What's left out of 4
E = The last mapping available

> Numbers found - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
> Segments known - A, B, C, D, E, F, G

Now make numbers out of the mappings!
