# AdventOfCode2021

I decided to try and participate in [this year's event](https://adventofcode.com).

## Python?

![Me think, why waste time say lot word, when few word do trick](https://i.redd.it/o535z7jm22l41.png)

## Are the solutions any good?

No. Very unoptimised, and not very readable.

## Will I actually finish all of them?

I'm stupid.

## Finishing notes

Most solutions courtesy of [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/).

I was pretty amazed it [came over to JetBrains IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot), paired
with [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) these puzzles fly by.
